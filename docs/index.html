      <p>
        Welcome to the RandX documentation! If you've ever needed to create a
        random generator on the fly, this project is for you.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p style="color: red">
        This project is still in alpha! Make
        <a href="mailto:aries.powvalla@gmail.com">suggestions</a> to help us
        improve.

        Using this tool does <strong>not</strong> require technical knowledge of
        any programming language, and can be used in a fairly simple way. It is,
        however, highly expansive and shouldn't introduce any limitations. If it
        does, let us know so we can add a feature!
      </p>

      <h2 id="basic">Basic Example</h2>
      <p>
        Here's a basic example of a random generator. This is a simple generator
        that will output a random number of a random vehicle.
      </p>

      <textarea disabled id="d1" placeholder="Rands appear here..."></textarea>

      <h3 id="example-explanation">Detailed Explanation</h3>
      <p>
        The first line of the program starts with two forward slashes. This
        indicates a <strong>comment</strong>. The program will skip over this
        line, and is just meant to be a note for humans reading your generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        On line 3, we are telling the generator how many results we want to
        generate. We do this by setting a special value called "_amount" to a
        number between 1 and 1 billion. Be warned, values greater than 6 million
        may slow down your device or crash devices like old phones or ipads.
      </p>
      <p>
        On line 5, we start a <strong>list</strong>. When we create a generator,
        we can pull a random value from lists. In this case, we are pulling a
        random value from a list of vehicles. All lists must start with the
        "list" keyword and end with a colon.
      </p>
      <p style="color: red">
        Note: Variables and Lists are case-sensitive. This means that "vehicles"
        and "Vehicles" are two different lists. Variables and lists can contain
        letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with an underscore
        since these are reserved for special variables like "_amount".
      </p>
      <p>
        On line 6, we add our first item to the list: a car. Items in the list
        are case-sensitive, but the case can also be modified. This will be
        explained later. On line 7, we add another vehicle, this time a truck,
        in the same way. Note the dash character used as a bullet point.
      </p>
      <p>
        On line 8, you'll notice the quotes around the vehicle. This is because
        the vehicle has spaces in its name. We need to use quotes here to tell
        the generator that "hot" and "balloon" are part of the vehicles name.
        This will make more sense as we look at the next item in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        On line 9, we add a spaceship to the list. Note the "%10" after the
        name. You can use the percent symbol pared with a number to represent
        the odds this item should have to be picked. In this case, the spaceship
        has a 10% chance of being picked, and since our list has 4 other items,
        each other item will split the remaining 90% of the odds. That means
        there is a 22.5% chance of each other item being picked.
      </p>
      <p>
        On line 10, we add "megatron" to our list. Note that this time, the name
        has quotes around it, but before each quote is a backslash. If the hot
        air baloon on line 8 is chosen, the quotes will not appear because they
        are being used to support spaces in the name. Since there is a backslash
        before each quote on line 10, the quotes will appear if this item is
        randomly chosen.
      </p>
      <p style="color: red">
        Note: Quotes come in pairs. If you use a quote without a backslash, you
        must use another quote without a backslash to close the name. If you use
        a backslash before a quote, it does not need another quote since a
        backslash makes the quote be treated like any other letter.
        <br /><br />
        Examples:
        <br />
        "text" - This is a valid name because the quotes are in pairs.
        <br />
        \"text\" - This is a valid name because the backslashes makes the quotes
        be treated like any other letter.
        <br />
        "text\" - This is an invalid name because the first quote does not have
        a pair.
        <br />
        \"text - This is a valid name for the same reason as the second example.
      </p>
      <p>The list has now ended.</p>
      <p>
        On line 12, we see the keyword "result" followed by a colon. This means
        that the content on line 13 is what will be generated as a final result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Line 13 starts with the text "I want". This means that for every
        generation we perform, the text generated will start with "I want". This
        is known as static text because it never changes. The next thing we see
        is "[1-6]". This is a quick tool to generate a random number from 1 to
        6, inclusive. This could also be done by creating a list called
        "numbers", and adding every number from 1 to 6 to the list. Next, we see
        "[vehicles]". This will pick a random item from our vehicles list. After
        the "[vehicles]" tag is the letter s. This makes whatever vehicle was
        picked plural. Keep in mind that this means if the number we randomly
        pick from 1 to 6 is 1, the grammar of the sentence will be incorrect
        (ex: 1 cars). We will show you how to fix this later. Finally, we see
        more static text, and this completes our result.
      </p>
      <p>This generator will produce text like:</p>
      <p>
        I want 5 cars please!<br />
        I want 3 spaceships please!<br />
        I want 6 hot air balloons please!<br />
        I want 1 trucks please!<br />
        I want 2 "megatron"s please!
      </p>

      <!-- <h2 id="beginner">Basic Syntax</h2>

      <p>
        The basic syntax of rscript is simple and relatively similar to standard pseudoscript. It is a line-based
        language, meaning that each line is a new command and/or serves its own purpose. The language is
        designed to be easy to read and write, and is pretty lenient with syntax.

        A rate limit is in place of 10000 generations per minute. This rate
        limit can be lifted for free if you are smart or determined enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        To lift the rate limit, send a POST request to
        ninjam.co/api/v1/terminal/dummy/randx-2. The auth token should be the
        computed hash of this html file. The user-agent header must be any
        non-standard Mozilla IX browser token. Send a payload containing the sum
        of the exact current unix timestamp and the BASE10 encoded value of this
        paragraph. Send the IP to remove the rate limit for as the user-fallback
        token.
