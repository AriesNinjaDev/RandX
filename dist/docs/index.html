            Welcome to the RandX documentation! If you've ever needed to
            create a random generator on the fly, this project is for you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p style="color: red">
            This project is still in alpha! Make
            <a href="mailto:aries.powvalla@gmail.com">suggestions</a> to
            help us improve.

            Using this tool does <strong>not</strong> require technical
            knowledge of any programming language, and can be used in a
            fairly simple way. It is, however, highly expansive and
            shouldn't introduce any limitations. If it does, let us know so
            we can add a feature!
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h2 id="example">Basic Example</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a basic example of a random generator. This is a simple
            generator that will output a random amount of a random vehicle.
        </p>

        <textarea disabled id="d1"></textarea>

        <h3 id="example-explanation">Detailed Explanation</h3>
        <p>
            The first line of the program starts with two forward slashes.
            This indicates a <strong>comment</strong>. The program will skip
            over this line and is just meant to be a note for humans reading
            your generator.
        </p>
        <p>
            On line 3, we are telling the generator how many results we want
            to generate. We do this by setting a special value called
            "_amount" to a number between 1 and 1.76 million. Be warned, values
            greater than 200 thousand may slow down or crash devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            On line 5, we start a <strong>list</strong>. When we create a
            generator, we can pull a random value from lists. In this case,
            we are pulling a random value from a list of vehicles. All lists
            must start with the "list" keyword and end with a colon.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
            Note: Variables and Lists are case-sensitive. This means that
            "vehicles" and "Vehicles" are two different lists. Variables and
            lists can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot
            start with an underscore since these are reserved for special
            variables like "_amount".
        </p>
        <p>
            On line 6, we add our first item to the list: a car. Items in
            the list are case-sensitive, but the case can also be modified.
            This will be explained later. On line 7, we add another vehicle,
            this time a truck, in the same way. Note the dash character used
            as a bullet point.
        </p>
        <p>
            On line 8, you'll notice the item has spaces in it. This is allowed! 
            Keep in mind that extra spaces and the beginning and the end will be 
            removed. If you want to keep spaces, you can use quotes around the 
            item. This will be explained later.
        </p>
        <p>
            On line 9, we add a spaceship to the list. Note the "10%" after
            the name. You can use the percent symbol paired with a number to
            represent the odds this item should have to be picked. In this
            case, the spaceship has a 10% chance of being picked, and since
            our list has 4 other items, each other item will split the
            remaining 90% of the odds. That means there is a 22.5% chance of
            each other item being picked.
        </p>
        <p>
            On line 10, we add "megatron" to our list. Note that this time,
            there is a backslash before the percent symbol. This is because
            the percent symbol is a special character in rscript. If you want
            to use a percent symbol in a name, you must use a backslash before
            it. This is known as an escape character. Escape characters are
            used to make special characters be treated like any other letter.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red">
            Note: This also applies to colons. If you want to use a colon in
            a name, you must use a backslash before it. This is because colons
            are used to define variables, lists, and results.
        </p>
        <p>The list has now ended.</p>
        <p>
            On line 12, we see the keyword "result" followed by a colon.
            This means that the content on line 13 is what will be generated
            as a final result.
        </p>
        <p>
            Line 13 starts with the text "I want". This means that for every
            generation we perform, the text generated will start with "I
            want". This is known as static text because it never changes.
            The next thing we see is "[1-6]". This is a quick tool to
            generate a random number from 1 to 6, inclusive. This could also
            be done by creating a list called "numbers", and adding every
            number from 1 to 6 to the list, but this shorthand is much more
            efficient. Next, we see "[vehicles]". This will pick a random item 
            from our vehicles list. After the "[vehicles]" tag is the letter 
            "s". This makes whatever vehicle was picked plural. Keep in mind 
            that this means if the number we randomly pick from 1 to 6 is 1, 
            the grammar of the sentence will be incorrect (ex: 1 cars). We will 
            show you how to fix this later. Finally, we see more static text, 
            and this completes our result.
        </p>
        <p>This generator will produce text like:</p>
        <p>
            I want 5 cars please!<br />
            I want 3 spaceships please!<br />
            I want 6 hot air balloons please!<br />
            I want 1 trucks please!<br />
            I want 2 megatron 5%s please!
        </p>

        <h2 id="beginner">Basic Syntax</h2>

        <> The basic syntax of rscript is simple and relatively similar to
            standard pseudoscript. It is a line-based language, meaning that
            each line is a new command and/or serves its own purpose. The
            language is designed to be easy to read and write, and is pretty
            lenient with syntax.

            <br /><br />

            <h3 id="b-keywords">Keywords</h3>
            <p>
                Keywords are words that tell the generator what you are trying
                to do on a specifc line/lines. This includes the list keyword,
                and the result keyword.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keywords are case-insensitive, meaning that "list" and "List"
                are the same thing. Use whatever floats your boat.
            </p>
            <textarea disabled id="bk1"></textarea>
            <textarea disabled id="bk2"></textarea>
            <p>
                The "result" keyword is the only required portion of any
                generator. without it, you couldn't get an output.
            </p>
            <h3 id="b-vars">Variables</h3>
            <p>
                Variables can be set by the user and are used to store and
                manipulate data.
            </p>
            <textarea disabled id="bt1"></textarea>
            <h3 id="b-comments">Comments</h3>

            <p>
                Comments are used to add notes to your generator. They are not
                read by the generator and are only for human consumption.
            </p>
            <textarea disabled id="bt2"></textarea>
            <h3 id="b-misc">Misc</h3>

            <p>
                There are a few other things that are important to know about
                the syntax of rscript.

            <h2 id="builtins">Builtin Variables</h2>

            <p>
                Builtin variables are variables that are reserved for specific
                purposes. These values are case-sensitive and are used to
                perform specific tasks. They typically modify the behavior of
                the generator in some way.
            </p>

            <textarea disabled id="sv1"></textarea>
            <p style="color: red">
                Variables are case-sensitive, meaning that "_amount" and
                "_Amount" are two different things (_Amount doesn't exist!). Use
                the correct case when using variables.
            </p>

            <hr />
            <h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>
            <p>
                Tags are what allow for the smooth usage of random generation
                and selection. Between tags that work on their own and tags that
                require variables as input, they makeup the backbone of the
                generator.
            </p>

            <h3 id="t-random">Random Tags</h3>
            <p>
                Random tags are used to generate random numbers, characters, or
                a combination.
            </p>
            <textarea disabled id="rt1"></textarea>

            <h3 id="t-dynamic">Dynamic Tags</h3>
            <p>
                Dynamic tags are to used to access and maniuplate varibles and
                lists.
            </p>
            <textarea disabled id="rt2"></textarea>

            <hr />
            <h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
            <p>
                Lists are used to store and access a group of items. These items
                can be anything from numbers to strings to timestamps.
            </p>

            <h3 id="l-modifiers">Inline Modifiers</h3>
            <p>
                Inline modifiers are used on individual list items to modify how
                they function or are chosen.
            </p>
